##Description##<br/>
HAZELSSPARKLYWORDLE is a single-player game.
Play has 6 tries to guess a word.
Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. Player hits the enter button to submit.
After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close player's guess was to the word.
Green - letter is in the word and in the correct spot
Yellow - letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
Grey - letter is not in the word in any spot
The game ends when all 6 tries are fully utilized or when player guesses the word correctly.
